# Disable warnings for intentional design decisions:
# - import-outside-toplevel: NFC libraries are conditionally imported
#   because they're optional hardware dependencies
# - broad-exception-caught: Necessary for hardware library error handling
# - too-many-statements, too-many-branches, too-many-locals: Acceptable
#   for main() functions that orchestrate multiple steps
# - duplicate-code: Similar patterns across scripts are acceptable
# - too-many-return-statements: Acceptable for validation functions
